# Mental Health & Social Media Balance Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
Analysis of 650,457+ users examining the relationship between social media usage patterns and mental wellbeing across different demographics.

**Portfolio Project for:** Data Analytics | Power BI | Data Storytelling

---

## 🎯 Key Findings

- **Screen Time Impact:** Users with 9+ hours daily show 39% lower happiness vs <3 hours users
- **Platform Matters:** LinkedIn users report 8.6/10 happiness vs TikTok at 6.3/10
- **Sleep Quality:** Strongest predictor of happiness (r = +0.68)
- **Stress Factor:** Stress level shows strongest negative correlation (r = -0.72)
- **Gen Z Vulnerable:** 16-20 age group most affected by social media negative effects
- **Exercise Benefit:** Regular exercise (4+ days/week) correlates with 28% happiness boost

## 🔍 Methodology

### Data Generation:
- Created realistic synthetic dataset with demographic-based behavior patterns
- Modeled platform preferences by age group (Gen Z: TikTok/Instagram → Mature Adults: Facebook/LinkedIn)
- Implemented realistic correlations:
  - Screen Time → Sleep Quality → Stress → Happiness (causal chain)
  - Platform choice → Usage patterns → Mental health outcomes
  - Age-specific vulnerabilities and resilience factors

### Analysis Approach:
1. Correlation analysis between key factors
2. Demographic segmentation and comparison
3. Platform-specific behavioral patterns
4. Health status distribution analysis
5. Trend analysis with predictive insights
6. Stakeholder-focused recommendations

## 💡 Key Insights for Stakeholders

### Executive Summary:
- 28.4% of users experience high stress (8+ level)
- Only 18.3% achieve optimal mental health
- Platform choice significantly impacts wellbeing
- Screen time reduction could improve happiness by 30-40% in vulnerable populations

### Business Impact:
- Healthier users show 32% better retention rates
- Mental health issues represent risk factor for churn
- Proactive interventions could protect ~$12-18M annual revenue
- Positions platform ahead of digital wellbeing regulations

### Implementation:
